1.0.8 (2016.04.02)
*****

1.0.7 (2016.04.01)
*****

1.0.6 (2016.03.20)
*****

FIX   GetDeviceCoordinates now uses new SystemInfo class, which resolves potential null reference issues. Thanks  Alexandr Reshetnikov.
ADD   Added "NoLeftClickDelay" TaskbarIcon dependency property, to optionally make left clicks work without delay. Thanks John Reynolds.
ADD   Overload to show built-in tray tooltips with big icons. Thanks amulware.


1.0.5 (2013.11.20)
*****

FIX   Support for x64 applications targeting .NET 4 x64 or higher (big thanks to Mark Junker for submitting a patch!)
CHG   Component does no longer throw an exception if no Explorer shell is present,
      but waits for it to be created.
CHG   NotifyIcon is not only removed on user-initiated disposal, but also garbage collection.
CHG   The attached ParentTaskbarIconProperty is now derived, so data binding to the attached DP
      becomes much simpler
	  (e.g. <TextBlock Text="{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self}, Path=(tb:TaskbarIcon.ParentTaskbarIcon).ToolTipText}" />)
CHG   WinAPI interop now uses Unicode in order to prevent issues with Asian languages. Thanks to JO Hyeong-Ryeol for posting an easy fix!
FIX   Context menues receiving keyboard events, which allows for TextBoxes in context menus.
FIX   Coordinates calculated properly on operating systems with non-standard DPIs. Thanks Rusi Filipov for bug reporting and testing.
FIX   Data-bound ToolTipText may have caused ToolTips to remain open in case of property changes.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0.4 (2009.09.21)
*****

FIX   If a popup is opened, its window handle is now being set as the foreground.
      This fixes an issue with certain controls being disabled on popups.
      (thanks Andrew Smith for pointing me in the right direction!).
FIX   Changed dispatcher access in order to work in WinForms scenarios, too.
FIX   Corrected typo in WindowMessageSink.BalloonToolTipChanged event (thanks Mertsch).
      Used internally (although event is public), so this shouldn't be a breaking change.
FIX   Dispose only deregisters OnExit event listenter if there is actually an
      application (not the case in WinForms environments).
      

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0.3 (2009.07.02)
*****
FIX   Commands did not work with RoutedCommands which require an explicit target
      (thanks Rodolfo Grave).
ADD   Added command target properties for both left and double click commands.
      Allows to explicitly define another control as the target of a routed
      command.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0.2 (2009.05.18)
*****
FIX   Late-bound DataContext did not coerce properly with ContextMenu, thus
      assigning it the TaskbarIcon rather than the TaskbarIcon's DataContext.
      Thanks Nic Pillinger for discovering the issue.
      

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0.1 (2009.05.15)
*****
CHG   DataContext is also assigned to ContextMenu (thanks Nic Pillinger),
      and properly coerced for ToolTips and Popups. Also checks whether
      target item has a binding on the DataContext
      (does not just override if DataContext is null).
CHG   Popup creation no longer calls Popup.CreateRootPopup which tries to
      bind to dependency properties that do not exist, thus causing debug
      warnings (thanks to Loic Berthollet).
CHG   The LeftClickCommand now executes with a delay in order to make sure
      it's not a double-click.
FIX   Removed debug output in WindowMessageSink.
